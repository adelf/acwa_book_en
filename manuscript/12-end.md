# Conclusion

This book is only an overview of practices I found helpful in application development. Perhaps it will help someone choose what's right for their project. The main thing to understand is that it's not about rewriting every application using Event Sourcing. Each application requires its own approach, and the same practices may be excellent for some applications but harmful for others.
